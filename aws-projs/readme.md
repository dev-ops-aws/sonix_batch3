Project-1: S3 Website Hosting of Project Profile
--------------------------------------------------
Services Used
Amazon S3: For storing and hosting the static website files.
Amazon CloudFront: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast content delivery.
Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM): To obtain and manage SSL/TLS certificates for secure website access.
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitoring and logging service for tracking website performance.
AWS Developer Tools - GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
AWS CloudFormation: For infrastructure as code to automate resource provisioning.
Domain Mapping: Custom domain mapping (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).

-----------------------------------------------------

Phase 1: Static Website Hosting using CloudFront
Objective: To host a static website using AWS services and improve website performance through content delivery via CloudFront.

Steps:

Create an S3 Bucket for Website Hosting:

Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store static website files.
Configure the bucket for static website hosting.
Upload Website Files:

Upload your website's static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to the S3 bucket.
Configure Amazon CloudFront:

Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve your website content.
Configure the CloudFront distribution to use your S3 bucket as the origin.
Secure Your Website with HTTPS:

Use ACM to obtain an SSL/TLS certificate for secure website access.
Configure the CloudFront distribution to use the certificate, enabling HTTPS.
Domain Mapping:

Map your custom domain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com) to your CloudFront distribution. Consider using AWS Route 53 for DNS management.
Monitoring and Logging:

Set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor website performance and troubleshoot issues.
Phase 2: Implementing CI/CD - GitHub to S3
Objective: To set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for your static website using GitHub as the source repository, AWS CodePipeline for automation, and automatic reflection in both GitHub and S3. Additionally, set up CloudWatch to monitor 404 error rates.

Steps:

Source Code Repository:

Host your website's source code in a version control system. You'll use GitHub in this project.
Continuous Integration (CI):

Configure CI to automatically build your website whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Use AWS CodeBuild to create build environments and automate the build process.
Deployment (CD):

Implement a CD process to automatically deploy the built website to your S3 bucket.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Create a CI/CD pipeline that integrates your GitHub repository with AWS services.
Automate the CI and CD processes based on code changes.
Testing:

Implement testing as part of your CI/CD process to ensure your website works correctly after each deployment.
Monitoring and Logging:

Configure CloudWatch to monitor the CI/CD pipeline, as well as your website, specifically tracking 404 error rates.
Automation and Notifications:

Implement automation for rollback or corrective actions in case of deployment failures.
Configure notifications to alert relevant team members.
Scaling:

Plan for scaling your website as traffic grows. CloudFront helps with content delivery scalability.
Security:

Ensure proper security practices are in place in your CI/CD pipeline and website hosting setup.
Documentation:

Maintain detailed documentation, including architecture diagrams, configurations, and procedures.
Testing and Validation:

Before going live, thoroughly test the CI/CD process to ensure it correctly builds, deploys, and updates your website.
Continuous Improvement:

Regularly review and improve your CI/CD pipeline and website hosting setup to optimize performance and maintain reliability.
